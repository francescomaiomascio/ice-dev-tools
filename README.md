ICE DevTools is a **collection of development utilities** used across the ICE
ecosystem.

It groups shared helpers, detection logic, formatting tools, parsing utilities,
and experimental pipelines that support development and internal workflows.

ICE DevTools is intentionally generic.
Its scope and structure are expected to evolve.

---

## Purpose

ICE DevTools exists to:

- Host reusable development utilities
- Support internal tooling and experiments
- Centralize helpers used across ICE repositories
- Reduce duplication of low-level logic
- Act as a sandbox for future refactors

This repository does not represent a finalized product.

---

## Scope

ICE DevTools may include:

- Detection and parsing utilities
- Formatting and export helpers
- Generation pipelines and prototypes
- Validation and normalization logic
- Shared types and configuration helpers

The contents of this repository are **subject to change**.

---

## Design Notes

- Stability is not guaranteed
- APIs may change without notice
- Modules may be moved, renamed, or removed
- Functionality may later migrate to other ICE repositories

This repository prioritizes **flexibility over rigidity**.

---

## Usage

ICE DevTools is intended for **internal use** within the ICE ecosystem.

It may be consumed by:
- ICE Studio
- ICE AI
- ICE Runtime
- Development and testing workflows

External usage is not currently a goal.

---

## Status

This project is under **active development** and refactoring.
Consider all APIs provisional.
