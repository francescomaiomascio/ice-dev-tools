# ICE DevTools
## Development Utilities and Experimental Support Layer

ICE DevTools collects **generic development utilities**
used across the ICE ecosystem.

It exists to support **engineering work**, **experimentation**, and
**cross-repository reuse** without introducing new authority,
semantics, or architectural commitments.

ICE DevTools is intentionally **non-opinionated** and **non-canonical**.

---

## Position in the ICE Ecosystem

ICE DevTools is a **supporting repository**, not a core domain.

- It does not define axioms or invariants
- It does not participate in execution or governance
- It does not introduce architectural constraints
- It does not establish public contracts

Its role is purely **auxiliary**.

Nothing in ICE depends semantically on DevTools.

---

## Purpose

ICE DevTools exists to:

- host reusable, low-level development utilities
- reduce duplication across ICE repositories
- support prototyping and experimentation
- provide temporary homes for evolving helpers
- assist development, testing, and refactoring workflows

This repository optimizes **developer velocity**, not system meaning.

---

## Scope

ICE DevTools may contain:

- parsing and detection helpers
- formatting and transformation utilities
- validation and normalization logic
- experimental pipelines and prototypes
- shared development-time abstractions
- internal tooling and scripts

All contents are considered **non-canonical**.

---

## Stability and Evolution

ICE DevTools is intentionally unstable.

- APIs may change without notice
- Modules may be moved or removed
- Functionality may migrate to other repositories
- Nothing here is guaranteed long-term

This is expected and by design.

Stability belongs to Foundation and core domains,
not to development tooling.

---

## Authority and Governance

ICE DevTools has **no authority**.

- Code here does not justify execution
- Utilities here do not define behavior
- Nothing here overrides Foundation constraints

Any tool or helper that becomes structurally important
must be promoted into an appropriate ICE domain
and formalized accordingly.

---

## Usage

ICE DevTools is intended for **internal use** only.

It may be consumed by:

- ICE Runtime
- ICE Engine
- ICE AI
- ICE Studio
- internal development and test pipelines

External usage is neither required nor encouraged.

---

## Canonical Status

ICE DevTools is **explicitly non-canonical**.

If this repository disappeared,
the conceptual integrity of ICE would remain intact.

This is a feature, not a limitation.

---

## Status

ICE DevTools is under **active development**.

Expect change.

---

## Notes

Not everything belongs in the architecture.

ICE DevTools exists so that  
**the architecture can remain clean**.
